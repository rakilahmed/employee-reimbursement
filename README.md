# Expense Reimbursement System

This is a simple Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) that allows employees to submit requests for reimbursement. The system is designed to be used by both the employee and the manager.

- Update their profile information

## The manager can ...

- View all employees
- View all pending requests
- View all resolved requests
- View specific employee's pending requests
